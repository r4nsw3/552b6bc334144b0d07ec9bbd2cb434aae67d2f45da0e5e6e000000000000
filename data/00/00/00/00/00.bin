  |   Use your alchemic abilities to escape the island in this brutally     |
  |   challenging 2D action-platformer with no checkpoints. You'll get      |
  |   better... eventually.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment        |
  |   trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing   |
  |   and seemingly cursed Island. Tough but fair combat, responsive        |
  |   controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency   |
  |   panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding,           |
  |   visceral and cathartic action game.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching    |
  |   paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping      |
  |   threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final   |
  |   boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your      |
  |   progress for successive runs; new paths you've unlocked, access to    |
  |   new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Speaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay   |
  |   your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells,   |
  |   but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique    |
  |   twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize   |
  |   your character differently with each and every run.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   At the end of the day though, it's YOUR skills as a player that       |
  |   matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your          |
  |   skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in   |
  |   the park. Patience, you'll get better!... eventually.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   RogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world,   |
  |   with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping     |
  |   threat of permadeath.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll,   |
  |   more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay... The           |
  |   unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net       |
  |   makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run.               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Nonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked,    |
  |   special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach    |
  |   your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build,       |
  |   your play style, or just your mood.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Exploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes.      |
  |   Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea       |
  |   mist infused air...                                                   |
  |                                                                         |

  |                                                                         |
  |   Two new levels, two new bosses and stacks more content to explore     |
  |   and unlock... If you're good... Real good.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we've   |
  |   been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the             |
  |   community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn't be where     |
  |   we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you.       |
  |   Here's a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the    |
  |   people who have been hanging around since day 1, it's high level      |
  |   and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think     |
  |   reasonable.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Features:                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   New levels: You've got a new level that's connected to the main       |
  |   level structure and immediately available to anyone who's finished    |
  |   the game at least once. You've got another (poorly) hidden level,     |
  |   for the masochists who know that there is a Boss Cell 5.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   New Bosses: Mirroring the above, you've got a new completely          |
  |   different type of boss available in the main level structure, with    |
  |   another INSANELY difficult boss hidden behind even more               |
  |   ridiculously difficult content.                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   New content: There are 10 new enemies, 13 new weapons/skills and a    |
  |   bunch of other upgrades to core game systems. There are additions     |
  |   to the story/lore of the game, new secrets, new blueprints and...     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Skins: People have been requesting this for ages and we've finally    |
  |   found the time to make the necessary changes to accommodate the       |
  |   request. You've now got access to female skins, fluo skins and a      |
  |   Christmas tree skin, cos why the hell not.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   On top of these major changes we're continuously trying to update     |
  |   the game in ways that make it more challenging and more just, all     |
  |   the while remaining open to new players. As such you will notice      |
  |   that the difficulty has been rebalanced so that the entry level of    |
  |   the game, while extremely challenging is now in line with the 5       |
  |   extra difficulty levels available to those who like to suffer.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We hope that you like Rise of the Giant and would like to remind      |
  |   you that we're not done, we'll be continuing to make content for      |
  |   the game for as long as you keep demanding it, so feel free to let    |
  |   us know what you'd like to see and if we can make any changes that    |
  |   would make you happy.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Notes:                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
